         (title (en "Breaking change for @code{oci-prometheus-configuration} users."))
         (body (en "The @code{oci-prometheus-configuration} has been updated in a breaking way.  The reason for this change is that its default were always not general enough to be in gocix and were always a near copy of a configuration I had lying around.

To achieve what was achieved before with this configuration:

@lisp
(use-modules (oci services prometheus))
(operating-system
  ;; @dots{}
  (services
    (service oci-prometheus-service-type
             (oci-prometheus-configuration
               (network \"host\")))))
@end lisp

you can now use the following:

@lisp
(use-modules (oci services prometheus))
(operating-system
  ;; @dots{}
  (services
    (service oci-prometheus-service-type
             (oci-prometheus-configuration
               (file %prometheus-file)
               (network \"host\")))))
@end lisp

The @code{%prometheus-file} variable is provided for backward compatibility and @strong{will} be removed in the future.  You are encouraged to migrate your configuration to Guile records.  This is equivalent to the above examples:

@lisp
(use-modules (oci services prometheus))
(operating-system
  ;; @dots{}
  (services
    (service oci-prometheus-service-type
             (oci-prometheus-configuration
               (network \"host\")
               (record
                 (prometheus-configuration
                   (global
                     (prometheus-global-configuration
                       (scrape-interval \"30s\")
                       (scrape-timeout \"12s\")))
                   (scrape-configs
                     (list
                       (prometheus-scrape-configuration
                         (job-name \"prometheus\")
                         (metrics-path \"/metrics\")
                         (static-configs
                           (list (prometheus-static-config
                                   (targets '(\"localhost:9090\" \"localhost:9100\"))))))))))))))
@end lisp


This change allowed to implement Prometheus scrape jobs as Guile records so now humans and other Guix services can both use nice parentheses to setup jobs."))))
